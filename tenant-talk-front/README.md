Flatiroc Code School FullStack Development, Module 4 React Project.

Tenant Talk,
An example project built to demonstrate an understanding of React, states and props.

The app connects to an API I built, Tenant-talk-JSON-API (in my repo, WSINTRA) and gets the JSON data, it then list messages posted and allows a user to edit and post replies.
